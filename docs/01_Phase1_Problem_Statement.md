# Restaurant Booking Backend ‚Äî Project Documentation (Phase 1)

## 1. Problem Statement

Finding restaurants nearby that match your preferences‚Äîsuch as cuisine, price, or ratings‚Äîand then booking a table seamlessly can still be frustrating for users. Existing apps often lack real-time availability, proximity accuracy, and an efficient review system.

### **Goal:**

To build a **location-based restaurant booking platform** where users can:

* Discover nearby restaurants based on distance, cuisine, or price.
* View real ratings, reviews, menus, and photos.
* Book a table instantly with real-time availability.
* Allow restaurant owners/admins to manage listings, menus, and bookings.

This backend project will power that entire ecosystem ‚Äî handling data storage, geospatial search, user authentication, booking logic, and API endpoints for web and mobile clients.

## 2. System Overview

This backend system acts as the **core engine** of the platform. It provides RESTful APIs to clients, handling geolocation queries, restaurant information, bookings, reviews, and authentication.

### **Key Responsibilities:**

* Manage and store restaurant data including location, cuisines, images, and menus.
* Handle user registration, login, and secure JWT-based authentication.
* Process user requests for nearby restaurants using geospatial queries.
* Support CRUD operations for restaurants, menus, and bookings.
* Allow users to leave reviews and ratings.
* Manage booking operations with concurrency and conflict prevention.
* Provide role-based access control (user vs admin).

* I want to register and log in securely.
* I want to see restaurants near my current location.
* I want to filter results by cuisine, rating, or price.
* I want to view restaurant details, including menus, reviews, and distance.
* I want to book a table for a specific time and party size.
* I want to cancel or modify my booking.
* I want to leave a review and rating after visiting.

#### üßë‚Äçüç≥ As a Restaurant Owner / Admin:
